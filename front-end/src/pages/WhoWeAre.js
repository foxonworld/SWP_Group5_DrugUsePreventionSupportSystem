                Why Drug Prevention Matters
              </h2>
              <div className="prose">
                <p>
                  Every year, millions of young people and families are impacted by drug use, not only through addiction
                  but also through its emotional, social, and economic consequences. While treatment is important,{" "}
                  <strong>
                    early prevention has been proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the risk of drug
                    abuse
                  </strong>
                  . Prevention starts with awareness, education, and timely support.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, the reality is that many people don't know where to start. They may feel overwhelmed,
                  ashamed, or unaware of the risks. Teachers may lack resources to guide students. Parents may not know
                  how to start a conversation. Students may not feel safe asking questions.
